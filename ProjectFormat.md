### How to use

- The repositories created in this course are **private**. The only people with access are you, me, and the TAs for this course.
- Your answers to the projects are going to go in a `README.md` file that should already exist in the repository. You will edit this file with your project answers.
- The project writeup itself will exist in another file called `projectProcedure.md`.
- You may want to open these files in different tabs for easy access.
- Edit in GitHub (the website)
  - Click in to the file you want to edit
  - Click the pencil button on the right
  - To **save** your progress, go to the bottom of the page, where it says `Commit changes`.
  - Leave a message in the box where it says `Update README.md`, then select the green `Commit changes` confirmation button.
- To `clone` the repository:
  - Click the green `Code` button
  - Select `HTTPS` for username + password authentication or `SSH` for SSH key authentication
